# Vimium C Theme Builder Source TODOs

- [ ] setup minimal svelte & rescript project
- [ ] layout top-level sections/features
- [ ] create mock/preview vimium-c elements
- [ ] allow "standard" vimium-c stylesheets to work properly with these mock/preview elements so they are a good match to the real elements created by vimium-c
- [ ] figure out how to setup css vars to make modifying themes simpler
- [ ] preview/image creation mode(s)
- [ ] ability to copy/paste css
- [ ] ability to add README content
- [ ] figure out some method(s) for converting between themes for vimium-c <---> vimium
- [ ] potentially include full vimium support too
- [ ] cli that can output css themes, translate themes, output theme repos/projects, run the dev server, output preview images
